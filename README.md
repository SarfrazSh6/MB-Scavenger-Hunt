# 🦠 Microbes of NYUAD – Interactive Campus Scavenger Hunt

Microbes of NYUAD is an interactive, web-based scavenger hunt that maps microbiology concepts onto physical spaces across the NYU Abu Dhabi campus. By combining a clickable campus map, location-specific storytelling, short videos, and quizzes accessed via QR codes, this project encourages students to engage with microbes as part of their everyday environment and identity.

The experience blends science communication, digital storytelling, and embodied learning.
